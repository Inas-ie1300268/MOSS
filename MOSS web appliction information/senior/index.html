        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>
            Nowadays people tend to use online shopping systems, since it provides guidance and useful feedback. The objective of this project is to design, implement, test and validate a multi-facet online shopping system. The target system should help users to have better shopping experience. Our system should also minimize the number of clicks for the users, help them to get more specific query and find their target product in a rational way.

            Starting from existing online system such as Amazon, the purpose is to offer to the user different browsing trees depending on his/her preference. Advanced browsing should help the user to make best decisions during the purchase process. Customers should be able to view the structured results at run time starting from one or several attributes (i.e. price, category, description, mark, rank, etc.). The system should also display association rules to the user, within some support and confidence. This project should help sellers to improve the purchases and improve user experience by offering different attributes that can be helpful in their purchase.

        <h4>Project significance</h4>
       <p>
           The proposed solution will focus on popular online marketplaces items. Those marketplaces provide websites with search capabilities, but the results are shown in a way that is not optimal to help the user to reach his/her target in an organized way. Our project has many benefits to the stakeholders. For us, it gives us the experience to work with hidden databasesâ€™ APIs. It also gives a benefit to the users by providing a helpful interface that divides the page into three parts; first part contains the facets that the user chooses according to the desired filter, second part includes the tree and the third part involves rules that are extracted from the formal context. This means that the user can see the results in a more organized way using a tree where he can navigate through different paths. If the user clicks on the leaf node, our system will route the user to the item in the provider page. Also, the user has the option to go and choose directly an item from the extracted rules. The combination of the algorithms in this project is what makes it unique and new in the region.
