   <p>
       The project objective is to create a web application, which is a structured view for the user to reach his desired item(s) with a minimum amount of time. The goal now is to apply it to Amazon and it might be extended to eBay and other online shopping systems. The user submits a query to our system search box, the system will get the user input and search for it on different online shopping systems. The retrieved results are processed to generate a browsing tree and set of association rules that can be modified based on usersâ€™ selection of filtering attributes. The user chooses one or more attributes for browsing in the tree in a multi-facet way. He is also able to go through different paths in the tree until finding the desired items. The user may also select an item from the set of rules to make better and shorter item selections.
